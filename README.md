# 🔗 SysMLv2–AAS Integration

**SysMLv2–AAS Integration** bridges the gap between systems modeling and Industry 4.0 by transforming SysMLv2 models into Asset Administration Shell (AAS) representations. This integration enables digital twins to seamlessly ingest and leverage engineering designs modeled with SysMLv2.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔄 Converts SysMLv2 models into AAS submodels
- 🧩 Modular transformation pipeline for flexibility and extension
- 📦 Clean output compatible with digital twin ecosystems
- 🧪 Sample SysMLv2 models included for experimentation
